          <h2 class="lead">The CDC provides home care packages for Australians over 65. Read through to see what suits your particular needs.</h2>

          <p>Consumer directed care (CDC) is an Australian government funding initiative to provide Australians who are over 65 with access to Home Care Package (HCP).</p>

          <p>This new initiative came into effect on 1 July 2015.</p>

          <p>It aims to provide access to quality care at home. Most importantly, it allows complete control when making choices about the types of care and services you wish</p>

          <p>A Home Care Package (HCP) using ‘Consumer directed care’ allows you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determine your care and services such as how it is delivered, by whom and how often</li>
            <li>Create a personalised care plan with your service provider</li>
            <li>Flexibility to determine the level of involvement you have for managing your plan</li>
            <li>Understand how your HCP is funded</li>
            <li>Adjust your HCP so that your care needs are met</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 class="page-header">What does Consumer Directed Care (CDC) do?</h3>
          <p class="lead">The CDC allows people to be cared for while living at home for as long as possible.</p>

          <p>The CDC is a result of the The Federal Government’s Living Longer Better aged care reforms from 2012. These highlighted the importance of introducing greater choice, flexibility and persoanlisation to care at home.</p>

          <h3 class="page-header">What is the future of the Consumer Directed Care?</h3>

          <p>As part of the 2015 budget, the Federal Government announced that from February 2017:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Home care packages will be allocated to the consumer, allowing for them to choose what type of care they receive and who provides this care.</li>
            <li>The packages are portable, allowing for changes if the recipient wants to change service provider or if they move, they can take the package with them.</li>
          </ul>
