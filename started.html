    <h1>How to get started</h1>
    <h2>...</h2>

    <p>Once you have decided that a Home Care Package could be right for you, you will be offered a Home Care Agreement. This covers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Care Plan: what the package will provide</li>
      <li>How your package will be provided</li>
      <li>How much it will cost.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Home Care Package can only commence once you have settled on the Home Care Agreement.</p>

    <h3>Care Plan</h3>
    <p>Your Home Care Agreement involves a care plan regarding which care and services you require.</p>

    <p>Your personal goals are important for the development of your care plan. They will influence the type of care and services which will be able to support your needs. For example, a goal could be to “maintain an active lifestyle by being able to keep up your physical activity” or “attaining greater independence in mobility”.</p>

    <p>You will also identify your care needs which are the specific areas of your life which you have been assessed as needing additional care and support. These will be recognised through an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) and a discussion with you and relevant parties.</p>

    <p>The service provider will look at what support you already have in place.These could include carers, family members, local community and other services. The Home Care Package attempts to fill the gaps by meeting needs which are not currently being met by any other support networks.</p>

    <p>As a guide, your care plan may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What types of services you will receive</li>
      <li>Who will be providing each service</li>
      <li>Your personal degree of involvement for managing and coordinating service</li>
      <li>The timing of when services will be delivered</li>
      <li>The amount which you will be paying for the services</li>
    </ul>
